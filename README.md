## Tips and tricks for success in Retro Bowl:
Upgrade your coaches first – Focus on upgrading your offensive and defensive coordinators before other upgrades. Better coaches make your players better.

Go for 4th down conversions and 2-point conversions – Be aggressive in key situations to keep drives alive and rack up points. The reward often outweighs the risks.

Mix up your plays – Don’t stick with the same plays over and over. Mix it up to keep opponents guessing. Go with inside runs, outside runs, short passes, play action, etc.

Maximize your salary cap – Structure contracts so you have enough cap space to afford good talent at every position. Don’t overspend on one-star player.

Draft young players – Rookies take time to develop but have longer peak performance years. Draft wisely for the future.

Defense wins championships – Don’t neglect your defense. A strong defense will win you tough games. Prioritize defensive linemen and secondary talent.

Watch stamina – Keep an eye on player stamina levels and substitute when needed to avoid fatigue issues. Tired players are injury-prone.

Be patient – Don’t force passes and runs. Let plays develop. Oftentimes the best opportunities come from waiting an extra second or two.

Learn your playbook – Knowing which plays are most effective for situations like 3rd and short, red zone trips, clock-killing drives, etc. is key.
